       <h4>Newly-recognised as a distinct species in 2016, this glossy, scarlet-and-black insectivore has the unwanted distinction of becoming the first avian extinction recorded in the Galapagos. First discovered during Charles Darwin’s voyage in 1835, invasive plants soon began crowding out the islands’ native vegetation, which in turn led to the decline of the bird’s favoured insects. The resultant food shortages, coupled with avian pox and malaria, probably led to the species’ demise as the last reliable sighting was in 1987.An adult male Laysan honeycreeper had vermilion upperparts, an ashy-brown lower abdomen and underwing-coverts, and brownish-white undertail-coverts. Adult females were similar to the male, but had paler red feathers. After molting, the feathers were brighter but faded with sunlight exposure</h4>

        <h4>The Oʻahu ʻakialoa (Akialoa ellisana) was a Hawaiian honeycreeper in the subfamily Carduelinae of the family Fringillidae (finches). It was formerly considered a subspecies in the greater akialoa complex before being elevated to a full species. It was endemic to the island of Oʻahu in the Hawaiian Islands.A Hawaiian honeycreeper with a spectacular bill, this insectivore would use its bill to probe through tree bark in search of arthropods, also using it to collect nectar from flowers. Formerly one Extinct species, it is now recognised as one of three separate Extinct species, all of which disappeared as a result of deforestation. It was also presumably susceptible to avian malaria, an introduced disease carried by mosquitoes.The bird was a long-billed insectivorous bird that was found in the high elevation forest. It was a dull colored species, dull green on the belly, bright green on rump and tail, dark olive-gray back and speckled yellow and green on the head. It was mainly an insectivore, using its bill to probe through the bark in search of arthropods, also using its long bill to probe flowers for nectar.</h4>

            <h4>This extinct finch was described from two sets of skins taken from the Ogasawara islands in Japan during expeditions in the 1820s. Over three decades later, after the islands became a stopover for whalers, naturalist William Stimpson reported that there were no grosbeaks left. Instead, he found countless – you guessed it! – introduced animals, including rats, sheep, dogs, cats, pigs and feral goats.It was a retiring although not shy bird, and was usually found singly or in pairs. It fed on fruits and buds which were primarily picked up from the ground or low shrubs; it rarely was observed to perch in trees, being apparently rather phlegmatic and somewhat reluctant to fly. Only one kind of vocalization has been described: a soft, pure and high note, sometimes short, sometimes drawn out; sometimes given singly, sometimes in a short series.</h4>

        <h4>Habitat loss and predation by cats, rats and people caused this oriole’s extinction. Known from New Zealand’s North Island, the last confirmed record dates from 1902, and there were no reports at all since 1970. The Piopio’s last stronghold later gained protected status when it became Whanganui National Park, but this didn’t occur until 1986, long after it became extinct. There was also a South Island Piopio Turnagra capensis, which became extinct by 1963 for much the same reasons.For many years, the North Island piopio was considered to be conspecific with the South Island piopio, but the two are now regarded as two separate species due to their pronounced differences in external appearance and osteology (Olson et al., 1983). An alternate name for the North Island piopio is the North Island thrush. The introduction of foreign predatory mammals such as cats and rats to New Zealand's North Island is mostly to blame for the North Island piopio's extinction, with habitat loss and predation by mustelids also being significant from the 1880s onward.</h4>

       <h4>This pink-eyed forest dweller was a once-abundant species endemic to Lord Howe Island, Australia. That all changed when a shipwreck washed up on the island’s shores, containing stowaway black rats. These rodents hopped off the sinking ship and began sinking their teeth in the Gerygone’s nests. Last heard from  in 1928, none were found on a survey eight years later.On average, the Lord Howe gerygone grew to be roughly 12 centimeters and weighed 6 to 7 grams.[citation needed] The small body type is common with perching songbirds. The meaning of gerygone is 'born of sound'.[citation needed] It lived in the canopy of Australian forests and its small body coupled with its thin bill was ideal for feeding on small insects.</h4>
